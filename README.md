## *Heads up:*
*This repository will be archived soon as OSINTer no longer uses a single server-side application for data, state-management and rendering, but instead uses [OSINTapi](https://gitlab.com/osinter/api) for data-management server-side and [OSINTwebfrontend](https://gitlab.com/osinter/webfrontend) for handling client-side rendering af state-management. Amongst others, this means that the code present here, will seize working with the other code in the OSINTer project.*
